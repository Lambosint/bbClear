# 0.5.3 (May 1, 2013)

* Reverted the data wrapping mechanism back to a script tag, but using text/plain as the mime type so as not to break in IE. This should be the best of all pragmatic worlds, the only downside being the inaccurate mime type.

# 0.5.2 (Apr 30, 2013)

* Updating to bluebutton.js 0.0.10 (thanks to @blacktm)
* Enforce alphabetical order of script injection (thanks to @jmandel)
* Updated README with dependency information.

# 0.5.1 (Apr 19, 2013)

* Updating to bluebutton.js 0.0.9 (thanks to @blacktm)
* Improving build script to handle replaced files

# 0.5.0 (Apr 15, 2013)
